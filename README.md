Repository for Data Analytics module 3.           
Code is mine but got help from stack overflow for list of commands and suggestions on how to code the main loop.                        
path to csv files was relative, not absolute.                              
Code for each part located in the file 'main.py' under the applicable folders.                           
'Analysis' and 'resource' folders contain the results of the text files and the original csv data, respectively, for each part.
